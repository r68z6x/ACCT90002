Part B – Short Answer Questions 
The following questions are based on the financial statements and financial data provided for Coles Group Ltd.
Question 21  [6 marks] As a retailer, Coles has a material asset in its inventory. Identify and explain two (2) accounting choices with respect to inventory that could potentially be used to manipulate reported net income and their effect on reported net income.
Question 22  [6 marks] Consider the Coles Group’s current ratio over the period FY2019 to FY2023 in a times- series comparison, and in relation to the industry average of 5.9 for FY2023 as a cross- sectional comparison.
(a) Why are benchmarks needed in ratio analysis? [1 mark] 
(b) Explain whether the level of Coles’ current ratio is a cause for concern. [5 marks] 
Question 23   [6 marks] 
On 1 May 2023, Coles Group completed the sale of its fuel and convenience retailing business (Coles Express, previously presented as a reportable segment) to Viva Energy Group for $319 million.
(a) Why are segment reports important to analysts? [1 mark] 
(b) Identify and explain which elements of Coles’ financial statements will be affected in the 2023 reporting period, and in future reporting periods by the sale of Coles Express. [5 marks] 
Question 24 [6 marks] Conduct a profitability analysis for Coles Group Ltd, by calculating its Return on Equity (ROE) and then decompose the ROE using the traditional (DuPont) method. You must show all workings. Comment on your results. Is ROE the best measure of firm profitability? Explain why or why not.
In addition to the profit margin, other alternative measures of profitability measure return on capital invested by all capital providers, unlike ROE which only measures returns to shareholders. ROE can also be manipulated by accounting choices (e.g, impairment charges) and distorted by reducing equity and increasing debt. However, the firm still has to earn profits to service its debt. Conclusion: ROE is one measure of profitability, but it doesn’t capture everything about a firm’s performance, and as always, it’s important to make industry comparisons.
